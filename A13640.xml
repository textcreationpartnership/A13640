            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18960:14"/>that this is one of the moÅ¿t vaine MonaÅ¿ticall fables, or ridiculous eluÅ¿ions of Sathan; I Å¿ay, for Å¿atisfaction of the ignorant, that this example hath for end and Å¿cope, the authorizing of one of the moÅ¿t pernitious errors of the Church of <hi>Rome, (viz)</hi> that the vow of leading a MonaÅ¿ticall life, is not onely lawfull, but alÅ¿o that hee which performeth it not, can by no meanes be Å¿aued, how Å¿olicitous Å¿oeuer hee be for clearing of his conÅ¿cience.

The purport of the letter is, The Matron <hi>Maria de la viÅ¿itacion,</hi> being eleauen yeares old, betooke her Å¿elfe to a Nunnery, and when Å¿he was of the age of Å¿ixteene yeares, our Lord appeared occularly to this religious woman, to recompence her merits, and took her for his Bride, and Å¿ince that time continueth alwaies to appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, granting her many particular fauours, talking familiarly with her, as one friend doth with another, after the Å¿ame manner that God conferred with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es,</hi> and oft times manifeÅ¿ted himÅ¿elfe to her, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Å¿hee and hee Saints, and helped her to pray her canonicall prayers, and at the end of euery PÅ¿alme, Å¿hee Å¿aid, <hi>gloria patri, &amp; tibi, &amp; Å¿piritui Å¿ancto,</hi> that is, glory be to the Father, and to you, and to the holy GhoÅ¿t.

In the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth page he Å¿aith, Å¿o often as in the Nunnery Å¿hee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18960:16"/>heard the bell that accompanied the holy Corps of our Sauiour carried through the Å¿treetes to the Å¿icke, Å¿he kneeled on the ground with teares, and was exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically tranÅ¿ported, as the Nunnes of the Å¿aid Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry teÅ¿tifieth: He further Å¿aith, that two Å¿euerall times, a CheÅ¿t wherein the Sacrament was, did open of it owne accord, and the EuchariÅ¿t lept out of it into her mouth: Further, in the 12. page, when Å¿hee was at prayers in her Cell, the Nunnes Å¿aw her inuironed with are Å¿plendency, and lifted vp into the aire, great brightneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿treaming from her breaÅ¿t and face, which Å¿ignified the great and feruent charity and loue of God which is in her: One day IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her, full of Å¿plendor, and crucified with his fiue holy wounds; out of his feete, hands, and Å¿ide, he Å¿hewed beames of fire, which darted vpon the hands, feete, and Å¿ide of this holy Nunne; the wounds and markes remained in her very beautifully, of Å¿anguine colour, as well on the in-Å¿ide as the out-Å¿ide of the palmes of her hands, and of her feete correÅ¿pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the one to the other, and being of a round fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as of a nayle.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd Letter was written by <hi>Lewis de Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> to the Patriarch of <hi>Valencia,</hi> wherein amongÅ¿t o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he Å¿aith, as followeth. <hi>The PrioreÅ¿Å¿e hath told me, that Å¿ince Å¿eauen yeares, Å¿he feeleth in her head, all the paines of the crowne of thornes, in Å¿uch extremity, that the bloud guÅ¿heth out, and Å¿he hath in her head, Å¿mall holes and paÅ¿Å¿ages made by the Å¿aid thornes.</hi>

               <p>The third Letter was written by the Å¿ame Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, <hi>Antonio de la Cerda</hi> vnto <hi>Fernando CaÅ¿tro,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curor in <hi>Rome</hi> for the Prouince of <hi>Portugall,</hi> therein

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18960:18"/>that the Å¿anctity of the PrioreÅ¿Å¿e was counterfeited, and the wounds painted, notwithÅ¿tanding the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿Å¿e denied it, vntil they took hard Å¿ope &amp; hot water, and waÅ¿ht her hands throughly with them, and the wounds ouer them; during the which, Å¿hee faigned the feeling of great paine: in concluÅ¿ion, when the wounds vaniÅ¿hed away, Å¿he fell on the ground, and began to weepe, Å¿igh, and craue mercy; caÅ¿ting her Å¿elfe at the Deputies feete, and being required to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth, Å¿he Å¿aid that Å¿hee had painted theÅ¿e wounds on her hands, &amp; did it ordinarily, &amp; that that one on her Å¿ide Å¿he had onely did it thrice with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, and that the crowne of thornes on her head, Å¿he had made it with pricking her Å¿elfe with a knife vntill the bloud followed, and that Å¿he had done this Å¿ixe or Å¿eauen times: being asked how Å¿he had figured the fiue drops of bloud vpon thoÅ¿e little clouts which Å¿he Å¿aid came from the wound of her Å¿ide; Å¿he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Å¿he had cunningly painted Å¿ome fine Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land cloath with bloud, and when they preÅ¿ented her any peices of linnen to touch the wound Å¿he fained to haue in her Å¿ide, Å¿hee did cut them in the preÅ¿ence of thoÅ¿e that gaue them her, Å¿haping them according to the forme of thoÅ¿e Å¿he carryed in her boÅ¿ome, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the peices Å¿he had receiued into her boÅ¿ome, Å¿hee pluckt it out, &amp; gaue inÅ¿tead of them thoÅ¿e which Å¿he had painted with bloud: Being demanded how Å¿herai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed her Å¿elfe vp, &amp; how the Nuns often times Å¿aw her glitter in her Cell; Å¿hee anÅ¿wered, that Å¿hee fiered a few coales in a Chafing-diÅ¿h, and did Å¿et it before a Looking-glaÅ¿Å¿e, and the beames of it which were in the Looking-glaÅ¿Å¿e, did reflect vpon her face; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18960:18"/>that Å¿hee might Å¿eeme to bee eleuated and lifted vp, Å¿he did put her feete into a high kinde of Å¿hooes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chapines,</hi> and Å¿ometimes vpon Å¿tilts, which Å¿hee had for that purpoÅ¿e; and was Å¿o dextriouÅ¿ly placed vpon them, that Å¿he Å¿eemed to bee in the aire. After theÅ¿e interrogatories, her faults being manifeÅ¿t, Å¿hee was condemned the 6. of <hi>December,</hi> 1588. in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tary of the mother of God of this City, and in her preÅ¿ence was pronounced and read her Å¿entence: She was not condemned to be burned, but onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned certaine MonaÅ¿tical penances, becauÅ¿e the fury and rage of the InquiÅ¿itors is onely Å¿atiated with the bloud of the truely faithfull, which they call <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> as alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e the Nunne was of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Order, of which Order moÅ¿t of the InquiÅ¿itors are.</p>
               <p>About the yeare of our Lord 1540. there was in the City of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> another Nunne which was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreÅ¿Å¿e of the Nunnery of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> who was condemned by the InquiÅ¿itors of the Å¿ame City for enormous crimes and compacts which Å¿he had made with the Diuell; by whoÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance Å¿hee did Å¿uch things, that throughout all <hi>Spaine</hi> Å¿hee was reputed and adored for a Saint: The HiÅ¿tory of whom, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian de Valera</hi> truely recounteth in his tractate of the MaÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
               <p>We may conclude from the premiÅ¿es, that Å¿eeing Miracles doe not alwaies accompany the true and Catholique Faith, and are common to the MiniÅ¿ters of God, and thoÅ¿e of the diuell, of whom Scripture witneÅ¿Å¿eth that he Å¿hall doe them, to deceiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the faithfull; experience alÅ¿o teacheth vs, that he

And yet if the PhariÅ¿ies could haue imputed vnto him or them the leaÅ¿t breach of Gods Law, they had liberty not to beleeue them; as the Å¿aid Doctor <hi>Payua</hi> proueth very learnedly,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and this is Å¿o pregnant a truth, that it cauÅ¿ed <hi>Lactantius</hi> to Å¿ay,<note place="margin">TorreÅ¿. en Å¿u PhiloÅ¿ophia mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. pag. <hi>849.</hi>
